## Logistic Regression - Sentiment Analysis

Today you will learn how to build a simple web application which applies your Machine Learning model.

* Download the Lab.tar [here](https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/ml101-khanhnguyen/week3/lab/week3_lab.tar)
* Solution: [notebook](https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/ml101-khanhnguyen/week3/lab/W3_Lab_Logistic_Regression-solution_20190516.ipynb)

### Milestone 1: Install Flask

We are running a server to implement your model and execute the predictions.

```
pip install flask
```

You can find [here](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/) all you need to know about Flask.

### Milestone 2: Run the app on your local

Now go to the folder `sentiment_analysis/` and run `python app.py`.

Open your browser and type in the URL `http://localhost:5000/`

Let's play around.

### Milestone 3: Build your own model

Let's open the notebook as usual and build your own model.

### Milestone 4: Deployment

Export your model and deploy it on the web application project.
