# Week 5 Lab: Credit Card Fraud Detection

Real-life classification problems consist of many cases in which the data is not “beautifully” balanced. In such cases, one may find the accuracy score of over 90%, but that may not be the happy ending. This is because we often want to focus only on the minority class, as it plays more important role in such problems. In order to tackle this, we need to come up with proper evaluation metrics and resampling techniques. One of the popular problem regarding imabalanced dataset is Credit Card Fraud Detection. Throughout this problem, we can illustrate well what we need to handle such an imbalanced dataset.
