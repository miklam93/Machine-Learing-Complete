## Milestone 1: Set up Jupyter

We'll be using Anaconda to install Python and Jupyter. Go to [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and download the appropriate package for your system. At the time of this writing, the latest version is 5.3.1. Please select the Python 3.7 version of the installer.

Going through the installer will install both Jupyter and Python onto your system.

Now launch notebooks. You can do from the command line (jupyter notebook) or by launching it from Anaconda Navigator.

## Milestone 2: Explore the dataset

Please follow instructions in the Notebook.
