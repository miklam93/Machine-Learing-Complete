Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning with algorithms inspired by the working of the human brain. These algorithms are referred to as artificial neural networks. Examples of these neural networks include Convolutional Neural Networks that are specifically used for image classification, Artificial Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks.

## Goal

* Understand TensorFlow Keras library and Neural Networks at a high level.
* Train a small neural network to handle classification tasks.
