The labeled dataset consists of 50,000 IMDB movie reviews, specially selected for sentiment analysis. The sentiment of reviews is binary, meaning the IMDB rating < 5 results in a sentiment score of 0, and rating >=7 have a sentiment score of 1. No individual movie has more than 30 reviews. The 25,000 reviews labeled training set does not include any of the same movies as the 25,000 review test set.

You should use the basic NPL technics and Logistic Regression to solve this. You can find all you need in the Lab section. Good luck and have fun!
