# Week 2 Project: Analyze the customer data

You just got some contract work with an Ecommerce company that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.

The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website. They've hired you on contract to help them figure it out!

## Bonus Project: Population Growth

The dataset is provided by [World Bank Group](http://www.worldbank.org/).

* Pre-reading: [Vietnamese Population Prediction](https://hackmd.io/s/ry4fBqCAQ)

In the Pre-reading blog post, only the data of Vietnam is captured. But a lot of data of other countries in the world from 1960 to 2017 are available too. Now your turn, let's start the Data Analysis Process:

### Step 1: Define Your Questions

You must begin with a clear defined problem. In the blog post it was *Vietnamese Population Prediction*.
Other examples: Analyzing and comparing China vs USA, Ranking of countries in GDP or Life Expectancy, etc.

### Step 2: Collect Data

With your question clearly defined, now it’s time to collect your data. Let's take out the data you need from the dataset.

### Step 3: Analyze Data

After you’ve collected the right data to answer your question from Step 1, it’s time for deeper data analysis. Begin by manipulating your data in a number of different ways, such as plotting it out and finding correlations.

### Step 4: Interpret Results

After analyzing your data and possibly conducting further research, it’s finally time to interpret your results.

Your problem could be predicting something, then you can apply the linear regression model that you have learned. Feel free to dive in any problem that you are interested in. The data is in your hand. you can start to make sense of it.
