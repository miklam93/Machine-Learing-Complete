# Week 4 Assignment

The Iris dataset was used in R.A. Fisher's classic 1936 paper, The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems, and can also be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

It includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower. One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.

### Objective: This notebook file should contains: 

1. __Introduction To Your Dataset__
    * The business background 
    * Why you choose this specific dataset to work on?
    * Which is the point/question you try to solve?
1. __Exploratory Data Analysis__
    * Analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us
1. __Build and Evaluate Model__
    * Build model
        * Classification problem
            * Logistic Regression
            * Decision Tree
            * Random Forest
                * Hyperparameter tuning
        * Regression problem
    * Evaluate Model
        * Classification problem
            * Confusion matrix
            * Classification report
        * Regression problem
            * RMSE
            * Plot residual distribution
1. __Further Investigate__
1. __Conclusion__

## Bonus (High recommend)
This note book helps you remind knowledge about EDA with pandas and seaborn
