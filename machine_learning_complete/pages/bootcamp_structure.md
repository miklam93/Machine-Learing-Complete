# Course Description

Welcome to CoderSchool's Machine Learning course. This course is 32 hours and divided into 16 sessions. Each week will have goals focused on *conceptual understanding* and *practical application*.


## Syllabus

### Week 1 - Exploring Data
Python Intro. What is Machine Learning?

**Goal**
1. Python: understand basic data type and if-else
1. Data Analysis and Visualization with pandas, seaborn, matplotlib

### Week 2 - Linear Regression
Linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between a scalar response (or dependent variable) and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables).

**Goal**
1. Simple Linear Regression
1. Multiple Linear Regression
1. Multinomial Linear Regression

### Week 3 - Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes
In machine learning and statistics, classification is the problem of identifying to which of a set of categories (sub-populations) a new observation belongs, on the basis of a training set of data containing observations (or instances) whose category membership is known. On this week, we use Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes to solve classification problems.

**Goal**
1. Understand classification problem
1. Create model, train model, make prediction with Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes model.

### Week 4 - Random Forests
Random Forest is a flexible, easy to use machine learning algorithm that produces, even without hyper-parameter tuning, a great result most of the time. 

**Goal**
1. Understand metrics to evaluate machine learning algorithms
1. Use Random Forest to solve classification problems

### Week 5 - KNN and SVM

This week will be focused on introducing basic concepts of KNN and SVM. SVM (Support Vector Machines) is one of the most successful classification methods in machine learning. And the solution of SVM also has a very intuitive interpretation. So it’s an elegant piece of work for machine learning.

**Goals**
1. Understand and apply KNN and SVM to solve classification problems
1. Understand KNN and distance metric
1. Understand imbalanced data and how to handle with it using Undersampling or Oversampling methods
1. Understand SVM and SVM Kernels
1. Practice SVM in Face Recognition Problem

### Week 6 - Unsupervised Learning

This week will instead focus on unsupervised learning

**Goal**
1. Understand PCA (Principal Components Analysis), a tool used for data visualization or data pre-processing before supervised techniques are applied
1. Understand clustering, a broad class of methods for discovering unknown subgroups in data.
 
### Week 7 - Time Series Analysis
Time series analysis is a statistical technique that deals with time series data, or trend analysis.  Time series data means that data is in a series of  particular time periods or intervals.

**Goals**
1. Describe the important features of the time series pattern.
1. Explain how the past affects the future or how two time series can “interact”.
1. Forecast future values of the series.

### Week 8 - Introduction to Deep Learning
Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning with algorithms inspired by the working of the human brain. These algorithms are referred to as artificial neural networks. Examples of these neural networks include Convolutional Neural Networks that are specifically used for image classification, Artificial Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks.

**Goal**
1. Understand TensorFlow library and Neural Networks at a high level.
1. Train a small neural network to classify images
