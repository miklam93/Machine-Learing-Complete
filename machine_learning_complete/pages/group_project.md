# Machine Learning Complete Demo Day

Congratulations on making it to 80% of the eight-week ML-C journey at CoderSchool. On behalf of CoderSchool Academic Team, I would like to show my appreciation for your dedication towards the course.

For now, it’s time for you to reflect your learning journey by doing the final project and performing it at the ML-C Demo Day on Monday, April 22nd, 2019.

## Dataset List

Here are several datasets suggested by the teachers. You can choose one of the datasets to execute the final Demo Day Project.

1. [Practice Problem: HR Analytics Challenge](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/wns-analytics-hackathon-2018-1/)

## Why do you need to do The Final Project?

The main goal of performing this project is applying your knowledge to real-world datasets. This project helps you review significantly every techniques and concepts throughout the course, moreover, how to make them applicable in real problems.

During the implementation, you will find yourself curious about the dataset and try to perform different machine learning techniques to obtain the answers. Most of innovative ideas are generated in this way. By researching and referencing different solutions, you can also learn various knowledge from other machine learning practitioners and this will push your improvement to exceed the limit.

## Timeline

In order to fulfill graduation requirements, you must follow the below stated small calendar in terms of dates

|Date|Time|Works|Why?|
|----|----|-----|----|
|Saturday, April 20th, 2019|23:59|Final Project Submission|This helps CoderSchool better well prepared with the event logistics on your Demo Day|
|Monday, April 22nd, 2019|19:00 - 21:00|Machine Learning Complete Demo Day|This demo day is a chance for you to take the challenge to overcome yourself and win a Google Home Mini.|

Students who are found successful and their theses were approved must submit their final projects by 23:59 on Saturday, April 20th, 2019.

## Guidelines

1. You will work in pairs or work individually on this final project and try to achieve as high as possible evaluation metric (The metric would be defined for you). 
2. FYI, in real-world problems, usually there are two approaches:
    * Come up with data first, and solve problems regarding that data.
    * Come up with the problem first, and collect the corresponding dataset.
<br/> For the sake of simplicity, we follow the 1st approach, because the process of collecting and preprocessing data is costly, which means it takes a tremendous amount of time and effort. 

__A small hint for you is you do not need to begin from scratch. Any techniques, concepts and innovative ideas that you find interesting (and beyond the scope of the course) are encouragely referenced and converted to be your own solution. (Make sure that you understand every concept you referenced so that you can deeply interpret them in your presentation)__

## Presentation Requirements

The information stated below is a recap of the requirements:
1. The project should be performed individually or in pair.
2. Your Presentation should be showcased within 5 - 7 minutes
3. There will be a three-minute Q&A section after your presentation finish (questions from the judges, teachers and peers) (optional)
4. You don’t need to prepare slides for your presentation. Instead, you are expected to submit a comprehensive IPython notebook upon the assigned deadline. Your notebook is considered to be comprehensive if it follows this baseline structure:

|Name|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Headline|Typically, when you are writing something that’s technical, you want a headline that’s appealing. This will help you to reach a wider audience and let your work have more visibility and impact as well. The headline or topics of your tutorial should include a short title (typically 10~15 maximum words). The title can include the technology and technique you are talking about, combined with a nice action verb that appeals to a wider audience. For instance, a possible title is as follows: “Predicting Vietnamese Population with Linear Regression”. You can get pretty creative with the headline, but keep in mind that this is the face of your article and it should be given plenty of tinkering before you finalize it.|
|Body|<li>Introduction To Your Dataset</li><li>Exploratory Data Analysis</li><li>Build and Evaluate Model</li><li>Further Investigate</li><li>Conclusion</li>|
|References|Remember to always give credit where it is due. It shows you are responsible and care for the long-term success of the community. Papers, other implementations, video, code repositories, etc.,are some of the things that you are looking for the reference. If you don’t want to include this very formal reference section, make sure to embed links throughout the tutorial as an alternative|

__These are just fundamental requirements for the presentation section. On the other hand, we highly recommend students to think out of the box and come up with any creative presentation styles that work for you.__

## Marking Rubric

These are the main criteria that will be used for the Demo Day Evaluation.

|Criteria|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|Rigor|<li>How scientifically sound is the material presented?</li><li>Did the presenter effectively explain his/her methodologies?</li><li>Did the presenter explain the decisions he/she made on how to approach and model the data? Were the approaches to handling the data fresh or novel?</li>|
|Story|<li>Does the data tell a compelling story?</li><li>How well was the presenter able to convey the importance of what he/she discovered?</li><li>Was the final conclusion satisfying and clear?</li>|
|Delight|<li>Personal Interactions with the audiences.</li><li>Did the presenter make an especially remarkable or memorable presentation?</li>|
