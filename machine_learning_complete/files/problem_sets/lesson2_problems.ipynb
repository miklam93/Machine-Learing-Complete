Let's assume that `voter_age_country` contains age data for the entire country of Thailand, and `voter_age_province` contains age data for the province of Amnat Charoen, which is the second most populous province in Thailand. You work for a political firm which is trying to determine voter turn out in Amnat Charoen. In order to more effectively target your advertising dollars, you decide to see analyze the average age of voters in Shanta. Thus you decide to test whether the average age of voters in Amnat Charoen differs from the average age of voters in the entire population of Thailand.\n",
