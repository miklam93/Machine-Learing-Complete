    "**Goal**\n",
    "After this first lesson, you should:\n",
    "1. Know how to setup a working python environment on your computer using anaconda\n",
    "2. Understand the following concepts:\n",
    "    - variance\n",
    "    - bias\n",
    "    - overfitting\n",
    "    - underfitting\n",

    "[numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) are libraries which help manipulate data in a structured manner. These libraries provide datastructures and algorithms that help manipulate data.\n",
